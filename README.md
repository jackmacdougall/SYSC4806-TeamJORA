# Project Description
Make an application that will allow students to evaluate their peers.  An Instructor will set up a list of items to be assessed, with a rubric for each item. Students are part of one and only one group. Students can add themselves to an existing group or create a new one. The Instructor can also create groups and assign existing students to a group. The instructor can also populate group memberships by uploading a file. A student can assess the peers in his/her group as per the rubric. The Instructor can also generate a report which has the average assessment of each student (average of assessments done about (not by) this student) for each item. The report should be downloadable in a CSV file so that the instructor can further process it in a spreadsheet.
