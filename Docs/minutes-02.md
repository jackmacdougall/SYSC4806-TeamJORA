Everyone do our parts and then get them done by Wednesday so that we can go over them in the lab.
lab to make sure we're on the right track.

Make sure we all do a little



Make it so that we start up the db with the students and info already there

Jack's issue is a great first issue!

Need to start work on the presentation
- do research on acceptance testing so that we can talk about that 
  *I'll make a new doc for talking about the research in the same shared doc*
  
  
  
To run, comment out first 4 lines in the applications properties, and make sure that you
Install postgres so that you can run it locally and it's on https://peerassessmenttool-jora.herokuapp.com/jorahome

Now we're gonna talk about what we all need to do:
On tuesday get as much done as we can.
Groups - Riley

Finalize schema.  

Jack got rid of the student list, it was messing up 

If something is making problems with the schema, remove it.

Remove Classes from the model. (if and only if they are breaking the system. be sure to notify group)

So in order for the eval to be saved for each student. Let's say they got a 4,3,2. so we can have a student result table. 

For the report we add up all the assessment values. we take the Item foreign key -> we can tackle this by Wednesday.

Jack is taking tomorrow off but is free for questions.


**Make sure to look over the kanban**
